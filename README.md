# roomy

**Roomy** is plain design, for generic content, designed by an amateur. It's the design used by [gregoryjscott.com][web].

**Roomy** is currently a set of Jekyll layouts, includes, and css. [Me][me] uses **roomy** to apply design to website content.

It's very much a work in progress and currently completely tied to my [content][content].
