Great! This is how it works.

<ol>
<li>Send me a quick email to let me know you're interested.</li>
<li>We'll start with a 1 - 2 hour meeting. You'll tell me about your technologies, problems, and ideas. I'll tell you how I can solve your problems and make your ideas become reality.</li>
<li>If we choose to pursue a business relationship then I'll send over a contract. The contract will define how the relationship will work including rates, payments, timelines, deliverables, and anything that I'll need from you to begin work.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Shoot me an email and let's get started!
